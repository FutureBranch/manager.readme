This document should help the reader discover how I think about work and my approach to management. My goal is to answer questions you might have.

## Who am I?

I'm an American that lives in Croatia. I've had a huge variety of jobs and lived in a ton of places. I like the Seattle Sounders, dogs (currently owning a Golden named Dina), playing and designing board games, and reading sci-fi.

I'm a reformed developer. I like double-diamond design. I prefer removable code over expandable code.

I'm an extrovert.

## My Role

My role is to create an environment where you can do what you do best. If you are a developer, then it is to remove distractions and complications that prevent you from shipping quality products and code.

## What I promise to give you

**One on Ones** - Weekly 30 minute (minimum) meetings. Topic picked by you. *Not* a project status meeting; instead things like career progression, feedback, your ideas for products or the company, goals and growth...

**Psychological safety** - Errors and mistakes are inevitable in life. Raise concerns and deal with them. If something can be improved speak up. Ask questions until you understand *why*.

**Work life balance** - I work to live, not live to work. I believe working long hours hurts more than helps.

**Transparency** - We default to transparent. Rarely information will be concealed. I will never lie to you.

**Feedback** - Green/Yellow/Red standings. Green is the default and unless otherwise explicitly stated in writing the state you are in. Yellow is a sign that our current state is unsustainable in the long run. If the situation doesn't improve, then a timeboxed improvement plan will be enacted. This is the Red state. Red is not the end of the world. Recovery is possible.

## What I expect from you

**Feedback** - If I am doing something that is hindering you or causing you stress, please immediately speak up.

**Reflection** - Take time to think and reflect. At least 1 hour per week at a consistent time, free from all distraction. It's usually best to do this on Fridays.

**Make decisions** - You are the subject matter expert. I can provide guidance, but technical decisions are ultimately yours.

**Async communication** - Email and Slack are distractions to core contributions. If something is especially urgent, we'll use the phone.

**You've read the company values** - and if you've asked questions about them if you needed to.

## Where I (maybe?) succeed

**Improving processes** - I hate bureaucracy and will do my best to eliminate pointless tasks.

**Asking questions** - I try to ask questions that make you think. Sometimes I ask questions so that I can learn.  It's okay to take time to answer.

## Where I (maybe?) fail

**Abandoning "the plan"** - I like to have a plan. I like the plan. Sometimes it's hard for me to abandon the plan for a new plan.

**Lack of recognition** - When someone isn't getting the recognition they deserve, I get upset. I can and should handle this in a less emotional way.
