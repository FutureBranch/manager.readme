This document should help the reader discover how I think about work and my approach to management. My goal is to answer questions you might have. It tries to answer: what makes me different than another manager that would be implementing the same policies?

## Who am I?

I'm an American that lives in Croatia. I've had a huge variety of jobs and lived in a ton of places. I like the Seattle Sounders, dogs (currently owning a Golden named Dina), playing and designing board games, and reading sci-fi.

I'm a reformed developer. I like double-diamond design. I prefer removable code over expandable code.

I'm an extrovert.

## My Role

My role is to create an environment where you can do what you do best. If you are a developer, then it is to remove distractions and complications that prevent you from shipping quality products and code.

## What I promise to give you

**One on Ones** - Weekly 30 minute (minimum) meetings. Topic picked by you. *Not* a project status meeting; instead things like career progression, feedback, your ideas for products or the company, goals and growth...

**Psychological safety** - Errors and mistakes are inevitable in life. Raise concerns and deal with them. If something can be improved speak up. Ask questions until you understand *why*.

**Work life balance** - I work to live, not live to work. I believe working long hours hurts more than helps.

**Transparency** - We default to transparent. Rarely information will be concealed. I will never lie to you.

**Feedback** - I criticize in privacy and praise in public. If you would prefer to be praised in privacy, please let me know. We follow the standard color coding for employee status and unless explicitly communicated in *writing*, you are green.

## What I expect from you

**Feedback** - If I am doing something that is hindering you or causing you stress, please immediately speak up. Don't hide things.

**Reflection** - Take time to think and reflect. At least 1 hour per week at a consistent time, free from all distraction. It's usually best to do this on Fridays.

**Make decisions** - You are the subject matter expert. I can provide guidance, but technical decisions are ultimately yours.

**Avoid distractions** - Some non-obvious distractions: meetings without an agenda, email, slack messages. Close messaging apps while you need to focus. Stand up and leave worthless meetings.

**You've read the company values** - and if you've asked questions about them if you needed to.

## Where I (maybe?) succeed

**Improving processes** - I hate bureaucracy and will do my best to eliminate pointless tasks.

**Asking questions** - I try to ask questions that make you think. Sometimes I ask questions so that I can learn.  It's okay to take time to answer.

## Where I (maybe?) fail

**Abandoning "the plan"** - I like to have a plan. I like the plan. Sometimes it's hard for me to abandon the plan for a new plan.

**Lack of recognition** - When someone isn't getting the recognition they deserve, I get upset. I can and should handle this in a less emotional way.
